## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

In this linear regression model we found the following results:

- Ground clearance, mpg (miles per gallon), and Intercept are statistically unlikely to provide a non-random amount of variance to the linear model.
- The slope of the linear model is not zero. The p-value of the linear regression analysis is 6.71 x 10-11 , which is smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This means there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, so the slope of the linear model is not zero. 
- This linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. From the linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 71% of the variability of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model.
